          I'm a designer who finds energy in ambiguity. When things are messy
          and undefined, I bring clarity and structure. Most recently, I was the
          early product designer at{" "}
          <a href="https://getbuilt.com" target="_blank" className="text-link">
            Built Technologies

          , where I helped shape the foundation for what became a platform
          powering over $300 billion in real estate finance.

          I care deeply about craft, but I also care that things work. I
          prototype in code, collaborate closely with engineers, and think in
          systems built to last. Whether working on zero-to-one products, design
          systems, or platform workflows, I aim to build with care, earn trust,
          and move the work forward.
